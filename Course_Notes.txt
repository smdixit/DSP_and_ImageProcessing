Discrete Time Signals
------------------------

Examples:
x[n] = ((n+5) mod 11) - 5.
x[n] = exp(j*pi*20/n).

I. Basic Signals:
1. Impulse:
	delta[n] = 1 for n=0,
		   0 for n!=0.

2. Unit step:
	u[n] = 1 for n>=0,
	       0 for n<0.

3. Exponential decay:
	x[n] = a^n*u[n], for a belongs to C and mod a < 1

4. Complex exponential
	x[n] = exp(j*w0*n + phi)

II. Elementary operations are:
Delay, sum, scaling, product, Integration and differentialtion.
Integration: y[n] = sum x[k] for k = -INF to n
Differentiation: y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1]. NOte: This is a discrete time approximation, more precise filters are there.

Any signal can be reproduced by x[n] = sum x[k]*delta[n-k] for k= -INF to +INF.

III. Energy and power
Energy of a discret-time signal Ex = (mod x[n])^2 for n= -INF to +INF.
A square-summable signal is called a finite-energy signal. That is, its sum converges.

Power Px = lim N->INF (1/2N) * (sum mod x[n])^2 for n = -N to N-1.

==> Finite-energy signals have zero power.
For periodic signals with infinite energy have finite power.
Px = (1/n)*(sum mod x[n])^2 for n = 0 to N-1
